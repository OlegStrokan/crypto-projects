#### Info:

In HoliVille, a special group called the "HoliDAO" has formed. This group is like a big family that shares a special treasury. Everyone who joins puts in some money, and together, they decide how to use it. This treasury is not just for saving; it's for helping others, especially during the Holi festival. The members of the HoliDAO come together to make sure everyone in their community can enjoy the Holi celebrations. They use the treasury to support local artists, help those in need, and make the Holi season even more special for everyone.
